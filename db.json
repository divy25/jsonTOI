Speaking on the 'Big Technology Podcast', Cathcart didn't have good words for the iPhone maker.Cathart said that Apple's privacy labels are discriminatory and that the company is in fact not in favour of people using Android phones. I assume it’s in Apple’s interest to have everyone using an iPhone, I mean, obviously, it is. And you look at a place like the U.S., most people have an iPhone, and the messaging experience works better on iMessage if everyone else has an iPhone, said Cathart. It’s certainly in their strategic interest that people not use something like WhatsApp because they want people to not use an ",

			"description": "US economy contracted at its sharpest pace since World War two in 2020 as Covid-19 ravaged services businesses like restaurants and airlines, throwing millions of Americans out of work and into poverty. <br/>The commerce department&#x27;s snapshot of fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday also showed the recovery from the pandemic losing steam as the year wound down amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections and exhaustion of nearly $3 trillion in relief money from the government. <br/>The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and pledged to continue injecting money into the economy through bond purchases, noting that &quot;the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months.&quot; <br/>President Joe Biden has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, and could use the GDP report to lean on some lawmakers who have balked at the price tag soon after the government provided nearly $900 billion in additional stimulus at the end of December. <br/>The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance since 1946. That followed 2.2% growth in 2019 and was the first annual decline in GDP since the 2007-09 Great Recession. The economy plunged into recession last February <br/>In the fourth quarter, GDP increased at a 4% annualized rate as the virus and lack of another spending package curtailed consumer spending, and partially overshadowed robust manufacturing and the housing market. GDP growth for the last quarter was in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. <br/>The big step-back after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the July-September period left GDP well below its level at the end of 2019. With the virus not yet under control, economists are expecting growth to further slow down in the first quarter of 2021, before regaining speed by summer as the additional stimulus kicks in and more Americans get vaccinated. <br/>The services sector has borne the brunt of the coronavirus recession, disproportionately impacting lower-wage earners, who tend to be women and minorities. That has led to a so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out. <br/>The stars of the recovery have been the housing market and manufacturing as those who are still employed seek larger homes away from city centers, and buy electronics for home offices and schooling. Manufacturing&#x27;s share of GDP has increased to 11.9% from 11.6% at the end of 2019. <br/>A survey last week by professors at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame showed poverty increased by 2.4 percentage points to 11.8% in the second half of 2020, boosting the ranks of the poor by 8.1 million people. <br/>Rising poverty was underscored by persistent labor market weakness. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said 847,000 more people filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week. <br/>The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.",

While AWU is just for Google employees in the US, <!-- -->Alpha Global<!-- --> is formed by employees from across 13 regions in 10 countries which includes the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United States.

The report added, “AWU isn’t recognized by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and can’t require Alphabet or its subsidiaries like Google to negotiate a contract for its members.” It’s prowess can only be derived by adding more members and opting for “public pressure campaigns”. <br/>As for the new international union, it is affiliated with the UNI Global Union-- a major federation of labor unions.

			"description": "TOKYO: Stock markets rocketed higher on Monday after Pfizer said early data show its coronavirus vaccine is effective and investors breathed a sigh of relief after days of US presidential limbo ended with Democrat Joe Biden declared the president-elect. <br/>Markets were already sharply higher on the <a href='https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections' styleObj='[object Object]' class='' data-ga='within_article-topic_link|topic_https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-presidential-elections' frmappuse='1'>US election</a> result when Pfizer said that data shows vaccine shots may be 90% effective at preventing Covid-19, indicating the company is on track this month to file an emergency use application with US regulators. <br/>Any economic recovery depends on checking the pandemic, and investors pounced upon the news. Pfizer&#x27;s data is only preliminary and does not mean a vaccine is imminent. Getting the vaccine to billions of people will be a massive undertaking, even if it is approved. <br/>Dow futures jumped 4.2% higher while those for the S&amp;P 500 rose 3.1%. <br/>In Europe, France&#x27;s CAC 40 jumped 5.6% to 5,239, while Germany&#x27;s DAX surged 5.1% to 13,112. Britain&#x27;s FTSE 100 gained 4% to 6,145. <br/>Markets were already buoyant about the result of the US elections, which saw Biden win the presidency. <br/>&quot;This means less uncertainty, less turmoil in terms of foreign relations, and reversal of some futile policies which were put by the Trump administration,&quot; Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Ava Trade, said in a commentary. <br/>Many analysts expect trade tensions to de-escalate under a Biden presidency. Still, not all trade tensions are expected to vanish even if Biden rolls back some of the tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on US trading partners, especially China, in the past several years. <br/>The European Union pressed ahead Monday with plans to impose tariffs and other penalties on up to $4 billion worth of US goods and services over illegal American support for plane maker Boeing. That followed a World Trade Organization ruling in the US&#x27;s favor over EU support for Airbus. <br/>In Asian trading, Japan&#x27;s Nikkei 225 surged 2.1% to finish at 24,839.84. Australia&#x27;s S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 1.8% to 6,298.80. South Korea&#x27;s Kospi advanced 1.3% to 2,447.20. Hong Kong&#x27;s Hang Seng rose 1.2% to 26,016.17, while the Shanghai Composite gained 1.9% to 3,373.73. <br/>For now, investors seem inclined to shrug off Trump&#x27;s refusal to concede and threats of legal action. With Republicans expected to retain their grip on a majority in the Senate, they are betting on continuity in tax, regulatory and other policies, analysts said. <br/>&quot;Trump not conceding a loss is near-term noise looking to wrong-foot Biden at the start of his presidency while Republicans in a position to not concede ground on legislation may continue to frustrate Biden&#x27;s agenda,&quot; Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. <br/>If Republicans remain in charge of the Senate, chances for a big package of economic aid are weaker, and the Federal Reserve will likely need to step up with more support, said Jeffrey Halley of Oanda. <br/>&quot;More easing is almost certainly on the way at December&#x27;s FOMC meeting,&quot; Halley said, referring to the Fed&#x27;s policy making committee. &quot;Looser monetary policy equals higher asset prices in a zero percent interest rate world.&quot; <br/>Despite rising infections and deaths from the pandemic, economies have continued to recover from the shocks of earlier shutdowns to combat outbreaks. <br/>Customs data released on Saturday showed China&#x27;s export growth accelerated in October, boosting the total so far this year back above pre-coronavirus levels for the first time. Exports in October rose 11.4% over a year earlier to $237.2 billion, up from September&#x27;s 9.9% gain, while imports rose 4.7% by value to $178.7 billion, decelerating from the previous month&#x27;s 13.2% surge. <br/>Biden has vowed to move decisively to try to counter the worsening coronavirus pandemic, which has sapped economic growth, trade and travel, as the US and Europe face a troubling rise in infections. Even if the strictest lockdowns don&#x27;t return in the United States, the worsening pandemic may dampen consumption and erase profits. <br/>In energy trading, US benchmark crude gained $3.16 to $40.30 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $3.08 to $42.53 a barrel. <br/>The dollar rose to 104.38 Japanese yen from 103.35 yen late Friday. The euro cost $1.1889, up from $1.1875. ",

			"description": "NEW DELHI: The <!-- -->Indian economy<!-- --> looking to register strong double-digit growth in FY22 to recover quickly from the current bout of Covid-19-induced slowdown, may have set itself an ambitious target that would be hard to achieve given the continuing weak debt growth indicating that the uptick in economic activity remains subdued. <br/>According to a brokerage report, the debt growth in non-government non-financial (NGNF) sector, meaning household and corporate sectors, remains tepid indicating weaker economic activity. The NGNF debt grew just 5.0 per cent YoY in 3QFY21 - only marginally better than the record low growth of 4.6 per cent in 2QFY21. <br/>Within the NGNF sector, household debt grew at a decent 9.6 per cent YoY in 3QFY21 (v/s 8.7% in the previous quarter) but non-financial corporate (NFC) debt grew mere 2.0 per cent YoY, similar to 2QFY21 levels as corporates still remained sceptical about the overall economic situation and rekey at t to commit more investments at this juncture. <br/>&quot;Such weak debt growth confirms the uptick in economic activity remains subdued. Coupled with our argument that COVID-19 may adversely impact India&#x27;s household income, this implies that a strong recovery looks highly ambitious,&quot; Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in its EcoScope report. <br/>During the time of the pandemic, it is the government that has borrowed the maximum to provide stimulus to the <!-- -->economy<!-- --> in the absence of private corporate investment. So against India&#x27;s non-financial sector (NFS) debt growth of 10.3 per cent YoY in 3QFY21 (the highest growth in six quarters), it the government (Center + states) debt that grew at a decade high of 16.3 per cent YoY and not the household and corporate sector. <br/>So, while India&#x27;s NFS debt stood at Rs 338 lakh crore in 3QFY21, up from Rs 314 lakh crore in 4QFY20 and Rs 330 lakh crore in 2QFY21, the 85 per cent increase in NFS debt in FY21 is attributable to the government sector as the corporate sector grew only marginally and households saw decent, but slower, growth in their outstanding debt.",

Individuals professionals and artisans are facing short-term hand-to-mouth existence though sectors are adapting to digital and live business models to stay afloat. <br/>Nine out of 10 respondents said they feared long-term impact of social distancing in the creative sector, resulting in a decline in audiences and earnings. The contraction is such that respondents felt nearly a sixth of the creative sectors were facing permanent closure to avoid bankruptcy. <br/>Queries for the survey were sent to 4,500 individuals and organisations on the British Council database, and through outreach partners. The link was live from September 1 to October 15, 2020 and 456 responses were received. <br/>In view of the findings and the feedback from creative industry, the report has recommended collaborative emergency action through investments by governments and corporates and strengthening of the creative economy by recognizing the cultural and creative sector as an integral part of the social and economic recovery plan, among other things. <br/>“While the first report helped to understand the immediate impact of Covid-19 on the creative economy; the second report reveals the diminished economic conditions that creative organisations and artists are now faced with,” said British Council director (Arts India) Jonathan Kennedy.",

			"description": "MUMBAI: In a major boost to self-redevelopment of cooperative housing societies, the <!-- -->Reserve Bank of India<!-- --> (RBI) has included them in the list of allowed borrowers for housing finance loan. <br/>This is for the first time that cooperative housing societies have been allowed to borrow from housing finance companies (HFCs). Earlier, societies in Mumbai could obtain loan for self-redevelopment only from the Mumbai District Co-operative Bank. <br/><div class='vxVV2 _3LJv_'><div class='3i5B2'>TimesView<p>Scarcity of open land means that Mumbai can now develop only through redevelopment. The current template of developer-led redevelopment is a failure, often not delivering the promised homes, and definitely not in the volumes required. Self-redevelopment appears to be the panacea. The authorities must tweak the financial ecosystems to align to this new reality.</p><small></small></div></div><br/>In a master direction issued last month the RBI said, “Housing finance shall mean financing for purchase/construction/reconstruction/renovati-on/repairs of residential dwelling units which includes loans to individuals or group of individuals including co-operative societies for construction/purchase of new dwelling unit.” <br/>Activist Chandrashekhar Prabhu said it is good news as it would encourage more societies to take up self-redevelopment. “There are 150 HFCs registered with the RBI many of whom have loaned to builders who have defaulted and these companies have lost money. It would be safer for them to lend to housing societies. HFCs can take money from National Housing Bank and disburse this to housing societies,” he said. <br/>Prabhu said that he would urge the RBI to further allow nationalised and private banks to lend directly to cooperative societies for self-redevelopment. “Today, no rule stops banks from loaning to housing societies, but the problem is that in case of default who will be responsible. The government seems apprehensive about these societies when they are the safest to lend to as they are middle-class people and will not default,” he added. <br/>But Salil Rameshchandra, president, Federation of Grantees of Government Land, said the RBI needs to do more. “Many societies are in need of redevelopment, as their plot size is small, no builder is interested. The RBI must prepare guidelines on how non-banking finance companies (NBFC), HFCs and all banks can provide support to such societies.” <br/>On the likelihood of societies defaulting on repayment, Rameschandra said it is very unlikely as residents would be the biggest losers if they do not redevelop in time. “The norms for housing societies need to be more relaxed than what they are for builders. The RBI needs to look at the changing housing scenario and make guidelines accordingly,” he suggested.",
